Lookout design issues:

Request format:

- A request should include a scheduling policy:
   * "time critical within n msec" (for obstacle avoidance; wall following)
   * "as time permits" (for object search)

Since the Pilot controls body motion, Lookout needs to be sensitive to
what Pilot is doing.

================================================================

TRACK
Current: look for largest region of specified color; project to ground; point head there

Problems:
  - do this in camera space so don't assume region is on ground (Ethan fixed this?)
  - what if we want to track a region other than the biggest one?
  - jitter when moving makes it hard to stay focused on an object, but Kei has done it
  - need a policy to reacquire target when lost
  - should track last position and area of target so we can glance away and come back

================================================================

FIND

Current: continuous scan; look for region of specified color

Problems:
  - what if you want to find blobs of two different colors?  don't want two scans
  - scan runs to completion; then has to come back to take snaps; better to snap as we go
  - we might prefer to use a list of gaze points so we can do shape extraction
  - offer predefined scan patterns, e.g., middle-foreground for lab10
  - need policy on what can move (head, body rotation, or full roaming search)
  - scan pattern should be more aggressive than a simple near-to-far
